    Description:<br />
    An experiment will be conducted in which participants will wear a headset and walk through a cityscape created in a
    virtual reality environment. Since they will be walking using a controller, they will not actually walk around. We
    will teach them how to operate the controllers on the day.
    Time required: 45 – 60 min. – explanation: 10 min, preparation: 8 min, training: 6 min, trials: 20-30min,
    questionnaire: 5 min. Rewards: 10 euros, paid directly.

    Note: There is a risk that your hair may be dishevelled as participants will wear a headset and headphones. There is
    also a risk of VR sickness. We will take breaks as appropriate.
